  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>Hi, I’m Nino, and I’m currently applying to the MS&E program. During the application process, I discovered that while the program offers immense flexibility, it also poses challenges in helping students organically connect with their peers.</p>
  <p>This realization inspired me to create this platform. By curating resources, events, and opportunities, my goal is to make it easier for MS&E students to find their community, collaborate, and thrive.</p>
