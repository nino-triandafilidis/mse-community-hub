  <h2>About This Project</h2>
  <p>At the heart of this project is a simple yet meaningful mission: to help MS&E students forge authentic connections that enhance their academic and personal journeys. While the program’s flexibility empowers students to tailor their experience, it can also create challenges in organically connecting with peers.</p>
  <p>Inspired by conversations with current students and recent alumni, we’ve crafted this platform to bridge those gaps. By curating resources, events, and opportunities, we aim to make it easier for students to find their community, collaborate, and thrive together. Whether you’re new to campus or looking to expand your network, this hub serves as your starting point.</p>
